# Segmenting-the-Travelers- A Classification-Based Study on Tour Purchase Behavior

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to predict tour package purchases using machine learning models. The goal is to improve marketing efficiency by identifying high-potential customers.

### Data Preparation
1. Missing values handled via median imputation
2. Categorical variables encoded as dummy variables
3. Data split: 60% training, 40% validation

### Models	                   
CART (Entropy)	     
Logistic Regression		     
Neural Network (Model B)	 
K-Means 
Clustering		      

### Key Takeaways
1. CART with Entropy was the most effective for predicting tour purchases
2. Logistic Regression offered model simplicity with decent accuracy
3. Neural Networks revealed deeper patterns in customer behavior
4. Clustering helped define marketing segments and personalization strategies
